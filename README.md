# MCCE4-Core

MCCE4-Core project is a streamlined version of the MCCE4 project available at [GunnerLab/MCCE4](https://github.com/GunnerLab/MCCE4) (private repository). The goal is to enhance code simplicity and compatibility by implementing only the core functions and essential tools, while retaining all the original algorithms.
