# Modeling Electrostatic Potential Using Coulomb's Law and Embedding Depth

delphi_ele.py will prepare a file from step2_out.pdb in which:
1. the atom radius will be set to the values used by embedding depth score calculation.
2. the atom charge will be set to +1 per conformer on one atom, so that the opp reports atom to atom ele
